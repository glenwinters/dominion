Just for the hell of it. May never actually get implemented.

Auction
Cost: 5 coin
Type: Reaction
Effects: When another player buys a card, you may reveal this from your hand. If you do, buy that card instead of the other player, paying 1 coin more than they would have.
or maybe: you discard the auction, and they get a chance to buy back at 1 higher.
or: the effect continues until someone can't or doesn't want to pay.



Consolation
Cost: 7 coin
Type: Action
Effects: While this card is in play, all treasures' values and costs are switched.
Note: this one became a bit less relevant since Prosperity was released.



Catapult
Cost: 5 coin
Type: Action
Effects: Choose a card from each opponents' hand without looking at the contents of their hand. He discards the card you chose.



Filibuster
Cost: 1 coin
Type: Action
Effects: +1 action. You may immediately return Filibuster from the play area to your hand.
Note: this one's basically a joke, though if KCed or TRed it could actually end up useful.
